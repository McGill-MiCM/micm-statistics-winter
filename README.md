# MiCM Introduction to Statistics in R

Welcome to this workshop! Thank you for attending! 

The goal of this workshop is to study some basic notions of Probability and Statistics with R. As this is a 4-hour workshop I will not have the time to go in depth into many topics but I selected a handful of them that I feel are basic notions researchers working with data should know.

There are two folders in this git repository. In the slides folder there is the Introduction-to-Statistics.rmd and a handful of html files. These have the material I will use to deliver the workshop and the exercises we will be doing. I suggest you recompile the rmd from scratch instead of downloading the html files but if you can't do that you can obviously look at the html files (but I have checked and for some reason they don't look as good as if you compiled it from scratch). To recompile the slides open the rmd file with RStudio and press knit. Normally RStudio will tell you if there is a package needed to compile the rmd that you don't already have installed in your computer. 

There is also the data folder. This folder has the datasets that we will be using in the workshop. Download these and place them in the folder you will be working in the day of the workshop.
