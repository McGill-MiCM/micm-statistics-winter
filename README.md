# MiCM Introduction to Statistics in R

If you are attending the workshop you will need a computer with RStudio. You will need all the packages necessary to compile an RMarkdown file and in particular  you will need the package bookdown. We will be working with the html files that come from the compilation of the rmd file that is called Introduction-to-Statistics.rmd but sometimes these don't look good so you might have to re-compile the rmd again.
