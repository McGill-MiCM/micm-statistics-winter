# MiCM Introduction to Statistics in R

Welcome to this workshop! Thank you for attending! 

The goal of this workshop is to study some basic notions of Probability and Statistics with R. As this is a 4-hour workshop I will not have the time to go in depth into many topics but I selected a handful of them that I feel are basic notions researchers working with data should know.

There are two folders in this git repository. In the slides folder there is the Introduction-to-Statistics.rmd file. This file has the material I will use to deliver the workshop and the exercises we will be doing. To compile it you will need RStudio and the package bookdown (install this package before compiling it!).

There is also the data folder. This folder has the datasets that we will be using in the workshop. Download these and place them in the folder you will be working in the day of the workshop.
